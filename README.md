# Task Assignment

To complete this task I created an app.js file, a page-template.js file, an index.html file and installed the following programs: node.js, Inquirer, Moment and Promise. Once the packages were installed a code was created to ask questions in the terminal. The answers would be generated on an HTML file that was linked to a CSS style sheet. To keep the HTML file refreshed upon each time the site was updated I created a distribution folder. This helped dispurse the data for the index.html page.

# Purpose of the Project
